# Diabetes Prediction - Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Diabetes Prediction** project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a person is diabetic based on health-related features. Using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, the model analyzes input data and provides predictions with significant accuracy.

## 🚀 Workflow
### 1️⃣ **Get the Diabetes Data**
- Used a publicly available **diabetes dataset** containing medical attributes.
- Loaded the data using Python libraries like `pandas` and `numpy`.

### 2️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**
- Checked for **missing values** and handled them appropriately.
- Standardized numerical values to ensure fair model training.
- Visualized data patterns to understand key trends.

### 3️⃣ **Split Data into Training & Testing Sets**
- Split the dataset into **training data (to train the model)** and **test data (to evaluate performance)**.
- Used `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` to ensure a balanced split.

### 4️⃣ **Train the SVM Classifier**
- Selected **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** as the primary model.
- Trained the model using the training dataset.
- Tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy.

### 5️⃣ **Test the Model**
- Evaluated the trained model using the test dataset.
- Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Compared predictions with actual results.

### 6️⃣ **Optimize the Model**
- Fine-tuned parameters to enhance model accuracy.
- Tested with different kernel functions to improve classification.
- Implemented cross-validation for better generalization.

## 📊 Model Performance
- **Accuracy on Training Data:** 78%
- **Accuracy on Test Data:** 77%

## 💻 How to Use the Model
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Prediction Script:**
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input patient_data.csv
   ```
4. **Interpret Output:**
   - `Diabetic` → The model predicts the person is diabetic.
   - `Non-Diabetic` → The model predicts the person is not diabetic.

## 🔧 Future Improvements
- Use **deep learning models** (e.g., Neural Networks) for improved accuracy.
- Expand dataset with more diverse medical records.
- Deploy as a **web app or API** for real-world accessibility.
