# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a crucial technique used by businesses to understand their customers and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. In this project, we use **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on **Annual Income & Shopping Score**, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

## 🔥 Workflow
1️⃣ **Data Collection** – Used a publicly available dataset containing customer demographics.  
2️⃣ **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned missing values and normalized data for better clustering.  
3️⃣ **Data Visualization** – Plotted customer distribution using scatter plots and histograms.  
4️⃣ **Finding Optimal K** – Used the **Elbow Method** to determine the best number of clusters.  
5️⃣ **Model Training** – Applied **K-Means Clustering** to group customers into segments.  
6️⃣ **Results & Insights** – Analyzed cluster characteristics to derive business insights.  

## 🚀 How It’s Done
### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing
We used a dataset containing **Annual Income and Shopping Score** of customers. The data was cleaned to remove missing values and scaled for uniformity.

### 2️⃣ Visualizing the Data
- Used **matplotlib & seaborn** to plot scatter plots and histograms.
- Observed natural grouping tendencies in the data.

### 3️⃣ Finding the Optimal Number of Clusters
- Applied the **Elbow Method** (plotting Within-Cluster Sum of Squares) to determine the best K.
- The optimal K was chosen where the **distortion score stabilizes**.

### 4️⃣ Training the K-Means Model
- Used **scikit-learn’s KMeans** function to train the model.
- Assigned customers to their respective segments.

### 5️⃣ Results & Insights
- Plotted the final clusters to visualize how customers were grouped.
- Extracted meaningful insights like **high-spending customers vs. budget shoppers**.
