# Classic Rock vs Mine - Machine Learning Project

## üìå Project Overview
The **Classic Rock vs Mine** project is a machine learning classification model that predicts whether a sonar signal is a rock or a mine. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze features extracted from the Sonar dataset to make accurate predictions.

## üöÄ Workflow
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Collection**
- Used the **Sonar dataset** (attached in the main folder), which contains sonar signals labeled as either **Rock** or **Mine**.
- Each sample has **60 numerical features** representing energy reflected by sonar signals at different frequencies.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Preprocessing**
- Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
- Normalized feature values to ensure consistent scaling.
- Split dataset into **training** and **testing** sets (typically 80-20 or 70-30 split).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Engineering**
- Utilized all 60 numerical attributes for training.
- Applied feature scaling using `StandardScaler` from `sklearn`.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Selection & Training**
- Used a **Linear Regression model** for classification.
- Trained the model on the processed dataset.
- Optimized hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision, Recall, F1-score**
  - **Confusion Matrix**
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - **Training Accuracy:** 84%
  - **Testing Accuracy:** 76%

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Future Deployment Plans**
- Model not yet deployed.
- Plan to save the trained model using `joblib`.
- Deploy as a web app using Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.

## üìù Dataset Information
- **Source:** Sonar dataset
- **Size:** 208 samples, each with 60 numerical features
- **Labels:** Rock (R), Mine (M)

## üíª How to Use the Model
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/classic-rock-vs-mine.git
   cd classic-rock-vs-mine
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Prediction Script:**
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input sample_data.csv
   ```
4. **Interpret Output:**
   - `Rock` ‚Üí The signal is classified as rock.
   - `Mine` ‚Üí The signal is classified as a mine.

## üîß Future Improvements
- Explore advanced models like **SVM, Random Forest, or Neural Networks**.
- Improve dataset size for better generalization.
- Implement real-time sonar signal classification in a web app.
